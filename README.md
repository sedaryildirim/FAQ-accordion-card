## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JS

### What I learned

how to position items with Z-Index, relative and asbolute positioning.

### Continued development

Have to work on making sites fully responsive at all screen sizes, error with floating image that needs to be fixed

I had quite a few layout positioning issues with this if anyone can help id love some feedback!

1) in 375px mobile view, when you the bg of the hero image moves when it shouldnt
2) in 375px mobile view, the hero img does not stay stationary when scaling in/out
3) could not get the BG img in desktop view to work at all without skewing the entire layout

this is as close as i could get it, if anyone can offer any suggestions or tips, id love them! thanks
